Functionalities

Screen 1 from the mock - (No authentication required) On the first screen, the user will enter his/her name and the password

You need to match the username and password with the fake data from this file and if it matches, send them to the next screen
 

Screen 2 from the mock - (If I am a lender) I will see a list of ALL the loans that have been requested by all borrowers in a table

Every row will have a button called “Fund”

The “Fund” button on a row gets deactivated when someone funds a loan

I will only see those loans that I have funded. Other lenders should not have access to my data or loans
